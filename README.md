# Microservices-Based JWT Authentication and Product Management API

This project is a microservices-based API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a comprehensive authentication system with advanced security features including Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and basic product management functionality. The system consists of three main services: an API Gateway, an Authentication Service, and a Product Service.

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture:

- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Product Service**: Manages product-related operations

## Services

### API Gateway
- Routes requests to auth and product services
- Handles 404 errors for undefined routes

### Auth Service
- User registration
- User login with JWT token generation
- Role-based access control

### Product Service
- CRUD operations for products
- Role-based access to certain operations
